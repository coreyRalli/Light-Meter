# Light Meter

## A simple utility allowing Amber Electirty and LIFX users to be more mindful of their energy usage during peak times and save money.

### How to use
---

For installation you'll need:
- NodeJS 8+
- Yarn or NPM
- Notepad/Visual Studio Code/some other text editor for configuration file

You'll need to create a new ```config.json``` file in the project directory (not included for security reasons). This is used to set and customise various options.

#### config.json Template
```
{
    "LIFX-token": "your-own-token",
    "postcode" : "3000",
    "light-selector": "all",
    "refresh-interval" : 60000,
    "safeColor" : "#1C7C54",
    "warningColor" : "#F9CB40",
    "dangerColor" : "#F04A00",
    "extremeDangerColor" : "#FF101F",
    "lightBrightness" : 1.0,
    "warningRange" : 20,
    "dangerRange" : 30,
    "extremeDangerRange" : 40,
    "lightTransitionDuration" : 1.0
}
```

```LIFX-token```: (string) Your personal LIFX API token. Refer to LIFX's own documenation for more information.\
```light-selector```: (string) LIFX API selector used to choose what light(s) to control. Refer to LIFX's documentation for more info.\
```postcode```: (string) The postcode the area you wish to monitor prices for.\
```refresh-interval```:  (number) The amount of times per-millisecond to check prices.\
```safeColor, warningColor, danger-color, extremeDangerColor```: (string) The colours for the light when energy is cheap, mild, expensive and very expensive respectively. Refer to LIFX's documentation for all supported formats.\
```warningRange, dangerRange, extremeDangerRange```: (number) The thresholds for each usage tier.
```lightBrightness```: (float) A value between 0.0 and 1.0 that represents the brightness of the light(s) controlled.\
```lightTransitionDuration```: (float) A value between 0.0 and 1.0 that represents the speed in which the lights(s) change colour or turn on.


Install the various depencies:\
```npm install``` - For npm users\
```yarn install``` for yarn users.

And to actually run:\
```node app```

(Once it's up and running, there's nothing more you need to do. I recomend running this on a raspberry pi to save power!)

### Why doesn't the price match what's on the app?
Speaking with Amber customer support (they're really good!), the current API provides the latest price within the 5 minute window the request was made (along with forecasts and a number of previous confirmed prices in 30 minute windows) while the app uses a weighted average of previous, current and forecasted prices to the arrive at the number you see on their app/website.

This utility is more meant to act as a general physical reminder to be aware of your energy usage (something I could of used when I cooked dinner in the air-fryer during a $7.50 period ðŸ˜¢).
